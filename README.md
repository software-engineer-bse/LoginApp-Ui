# LoginApp-Ui

Iâ€™ve developed this project with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose!

Features:
    Welcome Message: A warm, centered greeting at the top of the screen sets a friendly tone.
    Visual Appeal: A high-quality image that captures user attention and complements the login experience.
    Streamlined Input Fields:
        Email Field: Users can input their email address with a clear placeholder guiding them.
        Password Field: User can input password with an intuitive input area.
    Login Button: A prominent button that provides instant feedback with a success message upon click.
